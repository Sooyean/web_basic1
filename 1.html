  Starry, Statty night</a></u></strong></h3>
<h4>Don McLean</h4>
<p>Starry, starry night
<br>Paint your palette blue and gray
<br>Look out on a summer's day
<br>With eyes that know the darkness in my soul
<br>Shadows on the hills
<br>Sketch the trees and the daffodils
<br>Catch the breeze and the winter chills
<br>In colors on the snowy linen land</P>
<p>Now I understand what you tried to say to me
<br>And how you suffered for your sanity
<br>How you tried to set them free
<br>They would not listen, they did not know how
<br>Perhaps they'll listen now</p>
<p><br>Starry, starry night
<br>Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
<br>Swirling clouds in violet haze
<br>Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue
<br>Colors changing hue
<br>Morning fields of amber grain
<br>Weathered faces lined in pain
<br>Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand</p>
<p><br>Now I understand what you tried to say to me
<br>And how you suffered for your sanity
<br>And how you tried to set them free
<br>Perhaps they'll listen now</p>
<p><br>For they could not love you
<br>And when no hope was left inside
<br>On that starry, starry night
<br>You took your life as lovers often do
<br>But I could have told you, Vincent
<br>This world was never meant
<br>For one as beautiful as you</p>
<p><br>Starry, starry night
<br>Portraits hung in empty halls
<br>Frameless heads on nameless walls
<br>With eyes that watch the world and can't forget
<br>Like the strangers that you've met
<br>The ragged men in ragged clothes
<br>A silver thorn, a bloody rose
<br>Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow</p>
<p><br>Now I think I know what you tried to say to me
<br>And how you suffered for your sanity
<br>And how you tried to set them free
<br>They would not listen, they're not listening still
<br>Perhaps they never will</p>
<br>
